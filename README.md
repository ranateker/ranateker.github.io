**Minesweeper**

**game rules:**					
1. There are three different levels; beginner, intermediate, and expert.
2. Depending on the levels there are fields with different amounts of cells (8x8, 16x16, 16x30) and mines (10, 40, 99).
3. The goal is to find each mine and open up all cells that do not contain a mine.
4. How do you know where mines are? Every cell reveals a number of how many neighbours of them do contain a mine when opened up.
5. If you click on a mine => game over, if you open all cells whithout a mine => you win.

**How to play:**	
1. clicking on cells will reveal the content (if the cell itself is a mine game over, otherwise it will reveal how many neigbours of the cell has a mine in it).
2. right-clicking on cells will attach a flag to the cell which indicates for yourself there is a mine underneath. If a cell has a flag it cannot be opened.
